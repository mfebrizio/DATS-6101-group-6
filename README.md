## Initial Housekeeping

I created a .gitignore file with the R template and selected the MIT License â€“ a fairly permissive license for the project.

Also if any of you have a preference for a team name, I'm open to that. Personally, I'm indifferent to having a name.

Alex created a [page on OneNote](https://gwu0.sharepoint.com/sites/22SP_Dats6101_10M-GRP/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2F22SP_Dats6101_10M-GRP%2FSiteAssets%2F22SP_Dats6101_10M-GRP%20Notebook&wd=target%28_Collaboration%20Space%2FT6.one%7CECA6BC36-B95B-4F1F-833F-FD766D4E165F%2FTeam%20Project%20Brainstorm%7CB92533EC-1CA9-49E2-BD6E-C012CE298887%2F%29) for brainstorming project ideas. I think we should start sharing ideas there (even if they're very general). Once we figure out a shortlist of options, then we can add them to this ReadMe file. That could be a good way to practice markdown as well!

## Backgrounds

### Mark

In my day job, I work at an academic research center within GW's public policy school that focuses on regulatory policy. My educational background is in economics, where I learned some econometrics (mostly using the software Stata). Through work, I've worked to pick up and apply some Python programming (primarily to retrieve data from APIs and conduct data cleaning). Those experiences are my opening to data science, which I'm hoping to build on more systematically in this program. I'm new to R and RStudio, but the commonalities with Python have been helpful so far.

Interests: Federal regulatory policy (i.e., rulemaking conducted by administrative agencies like federal departments, the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Management and Budget, etc.); economic research; causal inference methods; text analysis

Familiar with data sources related to US regulation: public commenting ([Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/)); regulatory review ([Reginfo.gov](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/)); proposed and final rulemaking documents ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/))


### Alex

Hello everyone. I am a grad student here at GWU pursuing a M.S. in Applied Economics and a Graduate Certificate in Data Science. My undergraduate degrees were in Economics, Political Science, and Biological Sciences. I have experience using R, Python, and Stata for data analysis, primarily used for my research papers. I am still early in my career and my most recent job was working as an intern for the United Nations Foundation.

Interests: Economics, Health Economics, Econometrics, Epidemiology, and Social Epidemiology.
