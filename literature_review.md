- Abstract: "The ‘income inequality hypothesis’ holds that beyond a certain level of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the association between absolute income, health and mortality weakens, and the distribution of income across a society becomes more important as a determinant of a range of outcomes including average mental and physical health. Recent reviews suggest that the empirical reality of the income inequality hypothesis is now established but fierce debate remains about what explains the association. In this article we describe three hypotheses that have emerged in the literature to explain the association—the social capital, the status anxiety and the neo-materialist hypotheses before operationalizing each, and testing their ability to explain the relationship between income inequality measured using the GINI coefficient and mental well-being measured using the WHO5 scale. We use multi-level models and data from the European Quality of Life Survey which contains information from 30 countries and over 35,000 individuals. Results give most support to the status anxiety and social capital hypotheses and almost no support to the neo-materialist hypothesis. Measures representing the social capital hypothesis reduce the coefficient measuring income inequality by 55% in high GDP countries and render it insignificant as well as providing the best fitting model as measured by AIC and BIC value. However, variables representing the status anxiety hypothesis reduce the income inequality coefficient by more in lower GDP countries."  
- Notes:  
	+ income inequality hypothesis implies that a society's distribution of income is a determinant of mental and physical health outcomes
	+ income inequality measured using GINI coefficient
	+ mental health measured using WHO5 scale
	+ the article suggests there's some empirical consensus on the existence of this effect but differing views on the explanation and causes
	+ this paper focuses on Europe, so our question related to US persons is still relevant; also this appears to be country-level rather than more granular sub-national analysis

- Abstract: "There is a very large literature examining income inequality in relation to health. Early reviews came to different interpretations of the evidence, though a large majority of studies reported that health tended to be worse in more unequal societies. More recent studies, not included in those reviews, provide substantial new evidence. Our purpose in this paper is to assess whether or not wider income differences play a causal role leading to worse health. We conducted a literature review within an epidemiological causal framework and inferred the likelihood of a causal relationship between income inequality and health (including violence) by considering the evidence as a whole. The body of evidence strongly suggests that income inequality affects population health and wellbeing. The major causal criteria of temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack of alternative explanations are well supported. Of the small minority of studies which find no association, most can be explained by income inequality being measured at an inappropriate scale, the inclusion of mediating variables as controls, the use of subjective rather than objective measures of health, or follow up periods which are too short. The evidence that large income differences have damaging health and social consequences is strong and in most countries inequality is increasing. Narrowing the gap will improve the health and wellbeing of populations."  
- Notes:
	+ the article opens by establishing there is a strong causal link between income inequality and population health; however, the evidence on whether it also applies to "mental health, and public health issues such as violence, teenage births, child wellbeing, obesity, and more" is less clear
	+ Fig 1 "shows a cross sectional association between income inequality in developed countries and an index which combines data on: life expectancy, mental illness, obesity, infant mortality, teenage births, homicides, imprisonment, educational attainment, distrust and social mobility."
		- index combines several outcomes; we want to disentangle these relationships
	+ USA definitely seems to have worse outcomes and greater inequality compared to other developed countries; not clear what the sub-national
