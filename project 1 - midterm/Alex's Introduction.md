The relationship between economic inequality and health is a widely studied topic that is seeing increasing relevancy in the United States. As economic inequality grows within the United States, health outcomes are distinctly being observed along socioeconomic gradients. In other words, socioeconomic indicators appear to be associated with health disparities within various populations. While many scholars have studied the relationship between income inequality and human health, less research has focused on income inequality and people’s mental health. 

An initial literature review suggests that there are conflicting findings on the relationship between economic inequality and mental health. The range of findings in the papers reviewed include no relationship was found, a small relationship negative relationship was found, or the relationship depends on context of the variables being studied. Kelley & Evans determined that there was no strong relationship between income inequality and subjective well-being (Kelley & Evans, 2017). Picket and Wilkinson determined that there was a strong causal link between income inequality and population health, but that a connection between income inequality and mental health is unclear (Picket & Wilkinson, 2015). Layte found that income inequality influences mental and physical health outcomes but was uncertain of the specific mechanism and pathway of the effect (Layte, 2012). Bechtel et al. and Ribeiro et al., determined that there was a small significant negative association between mental health and inequality (Bechtel et al., 2012 | Ribeiro et al., 2017). Mathew and Brodersen found a significant negative association between mental health and inequality (Mathew & Brodersen, 2018). Sommet et al., found that income inequality affects the psychological health of only economically vulnerable individuals (Sommet et al., 2018). Tibber et al., determined that in that area-level income inequality is associated with poor mental health (Tibber et al., 2018). Finally, Zimmerman and Bell found that the effect of income inequality and health depends on the differences in social capital between different racial groups (Zimmerman & Bell, 2006). Overall, academic studies do suggest that there is a small negative relationship between mental health and economic inequality.

Given the findings from previous studies above, more research is needed to determine if there is a relationship between mental health in economic inequality. This project’s SMART question is what is the relationship between mental health and economic inequality within the United States from 2016 to 202? The null hypothesis for this question is that there is no relationship between mental and economic inequality that does not vary across geography. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a relationship between mental health and economic inequality that varies by geography. The aim of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis to investigate this SMART question.
