# Summary of Review {#header-1}

## Income Inequality and Mental Health {#header-1.1}

While the relationship between income inequality and health, generally, has been extensively studied, less focus has been paid to the relationship with mental health, specifically. Further, the results seem sensitive to the geographic locations studied and measures used. As a result, although the research area is not unexplored, there is still room for novel empirical investigations.

Two notable systematic reviews focus on summarizing the relationship between income inequality and mental health. First, Ribeiro et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of 27 studies exploring the relationship between income inequality and the incidence of mental health problems. Of these articles, 9 found a positive association, 10 found mixed results, and 8 found no association. The meta-analysis included both qualitative evaluation and pooled empirical analysis of select study results. The authors concluded, "Income inequality negatively affects mental health but the effect sizes are small and there is marked heterogeneity among studies." Second, Tibber et al. (2022) systematically reviewed 42  subnational studies (i.e., within countries rather than across countries) and determined whether they supported the Income Inequality Hypothesis or the Mixed Neighbourhood Hypothesis. A plurality of these studies focused on US populations. After controlling for absolute deprivation, approximately 55 percent of the studies supported the IIH, 12 percent supported the MNH, and the remaining studies (roughly 1/3) did not establish a conclusive association. The results were robust to mental health conditions, geographical unit size, and across countries with different incomes.

Considering these systematic reviews, as well as one-off studies, pursuing additional research on the relationship between income inequality and mental health is warranted. Given the heterogeneity in effects among countries and geographies, focusing on how the relationship between income inequality and mental health differs across regions of the US would be valuable. In addition, are there differences in the association between rural and urban areas (e.g., predominantly rural vs urban counties)?

In terms of measures, focusing on the prevalence of mental health problems would be a good place to start (i.e., the frequency of mental health issues within a population). Depending on the answer to that question, does the extent or severity of mental health problems matter too?

Lastly, distinguishing between subjective and objective measures seems critical, as they could produce different results. We should be careful to understand how our variables were measured and their potential limitations.

Volume 21, Issue S1 p. 4-17. June 2012.

- Abstract: "The causal association between absolute income and health is well-established; however, the relationship between income inequality and health is not. The conclusions from the received studies vary across the region or country studied and/or the methodology employed. Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia panel survey, this paper investigates the relationship between mental health and inequality in Australia. A variety of income inequality indices are calculated to test both the income inequality and relative deprivation hypotheses. We find that mental health is only adversely affected by the presence of relative deprivation to a very small degree. In addition, we do not find support for the income inequality hypothesis. Importantly, our results are robust to a number of sensitivity analyses."

- Notes:
	+ suggests that relationship between inequality and health is not well-established  
	+ results are for Australia  
	+ small effect for relative deprivation hypothesis and no effect for income inequality hypothesis  
	+ "An important distinction is made between two hypotheses within the RIH: the relative deprivation hypothesis (RDH), which detects an adverse association for some individuals within a group; and the income inequality hypothesis (IIH), which is a stronger association, suggesting that the whole reference group is adversely affected by the inequality within the group."  
	+ "The problem of endogeneity between mental health and individual income arises given that having a mental-health shock may reduce wages, just as having an income shock may reduce mental health. Using household income helps to reduce the potential for bias as other individuals within the household can still earn money, but this is not fully satisfactory."  
	+ "... only the relative deprivation has a small but significant negative effect on mental-health status."

- Highlights:
	+ Does societal income inequality harm individuals' quality of life, their subjective well-being?
	+ No. In developing nations inequality increases well-being by 8 points out of 100.
	+ In advanced nations it has no effect.
	+ Data from 169 surveys, 68 nations, over 200,000 cases; multi-level models with many controls.
	+ Flaws in prior research: Aggregate data, no split between developing and advanced, no GDP control.

- Notes:
	+ does not find strong relationship between income inequality and subjective well-being
		+ this does not seem identical to mental health but potentially related
		+ distinction between subjective vs objective measures seems critical
	+ inequality = Gini coefficient
	+ subjective well-being = World Values/European Values Surveys
	+ also uses European Quality of Life Surveys (EQLS) to extend analysis for just "advanced nations"
	+ Psychological well-being as an alternative outcome; no significant relationship
	+ "As far as we can tell from these European data, our analysis finding lack of effects of inequality on subjective well-being in advanced nations are likely to reflect a much broader pattern, extending to subjective health, mental well-being, quality of government services, and even to income itself."
	+ "Our findings suggest that research on inequality and well-being needs to distinguish systematically between developing and advanced societies: Inequality works differently in each type of society. And GDP per capita needs to be explicitly controlled throughout since it is correlated with inequality and stands as a good proxy for other important aspects of socioeconomic development (wealth, corruption, democracy, the rule of law, regulation of business)."

- Abstract: "The ‘income inequality hypothesis’ holds that beyond a certain level of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the association between absolute income, health and mortality weakens, and the distribution of income across a society becomes more important as a determinant of a range of outcomes including average mental and physical health. Recent reviews suggest that the empirical reality of the income inequality hypothesis is now established but fierce debate remains about what explains the association. In this article we describe three hypotheses that have emerged in the literature to explain the association—the social capital, the status anxiety and the neo-materialist hypotheses before operationalizing each, and testing their ability to explain the relationship between income inequality measured using the GINI coefficient and mental well-being measured using the WHO5 scale. We use multi-level models and data from the European Quality of Life Survey which contains information from 30 countries and over 35,000 individuals. Results give most support to the status anxiety and social capital hypotheses and almost no support to the neo-materialist hypothesis. Measures representing the social capital hypothesis reduce the coefficient measuring income inequality by 55% in high GDP countries and render it insignificant as well as providing the best fitting model as measured by AIC and BIC value. However, variables representing the status anxiety hypothesis reduce the income inequality coefficient by more in lower GDP countries."

- Notes:
	+ income inequality hypothesis implies that a society's distribution of income is a determinant of mental and physical health outcomes
	+ income inequality measured using GINI coefficient
	+ mental health measured using WHO5 scale
	+ the article suggests there's some empirical consensus on the existence of this effect but differing views on the explanation and causes
	+ this paper focuses on Europe, so our question related to US persons is still relevant; also this appears to be country-level rather than more granular sub-national analysis

- Highlights:
	+ Income inequality relates to higher rates of obesity, heavy drinking, and diabetes.
	+ It links to less exercise, physical/mental issues, heart disease/attack, depression.
	+ The income effect on health outweighs the income inequality effect on health.
	+ Income inequality has a differential impact on health along the income distribution.

- Abstract: "A growing body of research suggests a relationship between health and income inequality. This study specifically analyzes the correlation between income inequality, measured by state-level Gini coefficients from the American Community Survey (ACS), and individual behavioral, physical, and mental health outcomes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for 2006 through 2014. After controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health insurance status, year trends, and state fixed effects, income inequality was found to have significant relationships with behavioral, physical, and mental health outcomes, including heavy drinking, obesity, exercise, diabetes, heart attack, heart disease, physical and mental health problems, and depression, and often the impact on low-income individuals is slightly smaller than on the high-income group. The research suggests that economic policies to address the rising income inequality in the United States might serve to also address some of our nation’s most troubling health statistics."

- Notes:
	+ This study incorporates many other health variables and could be useful for different SMART questions too
	+ state-level Gini coefficient data across the USA
	+ "Health outcome measures and demographic information were obtained as cross-sectional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) annual Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)"
		- our data also draws from this original data source
	+ "Finally, to measure mental health, variables concerning depression and anxiety diagnoses, as well as whether or not the individual experienced poor mental health in the past month were studied."
	+ found a significant negative association between mental health and inequality
		- "Among the mental health variables, depressive disorder and having mental health problems in the past month proved to have a significant relationship with the Gini coefficient. However, the association was found to be negative, suggesting that an increase in income inequality would actually result in a 7.7 and 1.7-percentage-point reduction in the likelihoods of depression and mental health problems in an individual, respectively, with slightly larger reductions for the lowest income group (Table 2). This negative association is particularly surprising given the literature indicating a positive relationship, but may be explained by the limitations of the BRFSS dataset, an important consideration in understanding the data from the entire study."

- Abstract: "There is a very large literature examining income inequality in relation to health. Early reviews came to different interpretations of the evidence, though a large majority of studies reported that health tended to be worse in more unequal societies. More recent studies, not included in those reviews, provide substantial new evidence. Our purpose in this paper is to assess whether or not wider income differences play a causal role leading to worse health. We conducted a literature review within an epidemiological causal framework and inferred the likelihood of a causal relationship between income inequality and health (including violence) by considering the evidence as a whole. The body of evidence strongly suggests that income inequality affects population health and wellbeing. The major causal criteria of temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack of alternative explanations are well supported. Of the small minority of studies which find no association, most can be explained by income inequality being measured at an inappropriate scale, the inclusion of mediating variables as controls, the use of subjective rather than objective measures of health, or follow up periods which are too short. The evidence that large income differences have damaging health and social consequences is strong and in most countries inequality is increasing. Narrowing the gap will improve the health and wellbeing of populations."

- Notes:
	+ the article opens by establishing there is a strong causal link between income inequality and population health; however, the evidence on whether it also applies to "mental health, and public health issues such as violence, teenage births, child wellbeing, obesity, and more" is less clear
	+ Fig 1 "shows a cross sectional association between income inequality in developed countries and an index which combines data on: life expectancy, mental illness, obesity, infant mortality, teenage births, homicides, imprisonment, educational attainment, distrust and social mobility."
		- "Income inequality is measured by the ratio of incomes among the richest compared with the poorest 20% in each country." (same as one of the measures we plan on using)
		- index combines several outcomes; we want to disentangle these relationships
		- USA definitely seems to have worse outcomes and greater inequality compared to other developed countries; not clear what the sub-national relationship is though
	+ "There are now perhaps as many as 300 peer-reviewed studies of the relation between income inequality and measures of health or homicide."
	+ geographic scale for income inequality measures is important -- less support for the relationship as it becomes more granular
	+ conclusions: "The body of evidence on income inequality and health points strongly to a causal connection. The major criteria of temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack of alternative explanations are well supported. Of the small minority of studies which find no association, most can be explained by income inequality being measured at an inappropriate scale, the inclusion of mediating variables as controls, the use of subjective rather than objective measures of health, or follow up periods which are too short."

- Notes:
	+ meta-analysis of 27 studies examining the relationship between income inequality and the incidence of mental health problems
	+ "Nine articles found a positive association between income inequality and the prevalence or incidence of mental health problems; ten articles found mixed results, with positive association in some subgroups and non-significant or negative association in other subgroups; and eight articles found no association between income inequality and mental health problems."
	+ conclusion: "Income inequality negatively affects mental health but the effect sizes are small and there is marked heterogeneity among studies."
	+ found significant but small effects among pooled effect sizes for categorical variable (yes/no to existence of mental health problem and depressive disorder) 
	+ "Even though our narrative synthesis showed mixed results, its general trend suggests that income inequality negatively affects mental health, as did our meta-analysis. Therefore, our findings support the inclusion of income inequality in the public health agenda, because reducing income inequality could improve population mental health and wellbeing."

- Results: "Forty-two studies met criteria for inclusion representing nearly eight million participants and more than 110,000 geographical units. Of these, 54.76% supported the Income Inequality Hypothesis and 11.9% supported the Mixed Neighbourhood Hypothesis. This held for highest quality studies and after controlling for absolute deprivation. The results were consistent across mental health conditions, size of geographical units, and held for low/middle and high income countries."

- Notes:
	+ focuses on subnational studies -- "e.g. comparisons across neighbourhoods or states rather than across countries"
	+ "The largest proportion of studies (n=17, 40.48%) involved data gathered in the US."
	+ two different hypotheses
		1. Income Inequality Hypothesis -> association between higher inequality and poorer mental health
		2. Mixed Neighbourhood Hypothesis -> association between higher inequality and better mental health
	+ absolute deprivation is a relevant confounder for these analyses -- i.e., need to control for deprivation in data in order to adequately test the hypotheses
	+ Conclusion: "Nonetheless, the findings suggest that area-level income inequality is associated with poorer mental health, and provides support for the introduction of social, economic and public health policies that ameliorate the deleterious effects of income inequality."
	+ existing literature is limited
		- "Despite growing interest, there has been less research into the association between inequality and mental health than there has into the association with physical health [49]. Nonetheless, several systematic reviews of relevance have been undertaken. Burns and colleagues [50] undertook a systematic review of schizophrenia, and found that across data from 26 countries, there was a higher incidence rate of the condition in higher income countries (β = 1.02; Z = 2.28; p = 0.02; 95% CI = 1.00, 1.03). In a systematic review and meta-analysis of depression [51], from 26 papers (of which 12 were included in the meta-analysis), the authors reported a greater risk of depression in populations with higher inequality (RR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.07–1.31)."
		- "Only one review paper to date [52], however, has attempted to synthesise the literature on the association between inequality and mental health across different presentations. In their paper, the authors undertook a systematic review of 27 papers and a meta-analysis of nine studies, and concluded that there was a weak association between higher income inequality and any mental health difficulty (pooled Cohen’s d = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.01–0.11). However, in defining their search terms they included only broad definitions of mental health problems rather than specific diagnostic categories. Consequently, a number of studies of relevance may have been missed, and biases may have been introduced with respect to study selection. In addition, they did not assess the impact on their findings of including only studies that had controlled for absolute deprivation. However, without controlling for absolute deprivation, any reported effects of inequality may be driven by this factor rather than inequality per se [53, 54]."
	+ systematic review found the most support for income inequality hypothesis, but a large proportion of studies reported no significant association or mixed associations
		- "Based on a systematic review of the literature we consistently found greater support for the IIH over the MNH ... However, a high proportion of studies supported neither hypothesis, reporting no significant association between inequality and mental health, or else mixed patterns of associations."

- Notes:
	+ Focuses on a sample of ~4000 adults from the US population
	+ main outcome measures were mostly self-reported and/or subjective
	+ "The effect of income inequality on health may work through the influence of invidious social comparisons (particularly among white subjects) and (among black subjects and Latinos) through a reduction in social capital. Researchers may find it fruitful to recognise the cultural specificity of any such effects."
