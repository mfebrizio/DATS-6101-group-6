<h1 id="header-1">Summary of Review</h1>
<h2 id="header-1.1">Income Inequality and Mental Health</h2>
<p>While the relationship between income inequality and health,
generally, has been extensively studied, less focus has been paid to the
relationship with mental health, specifically. Further, the results seem
sensitive to the geographic locations studied and measures used. As a
result, although the research area is not unexplored, there is still
room for novel empirical investigations.</p>
<p>Two notable systematic reviews focus on summarizing the relationship
between income inequality and mental health. First, Ribeiro et
al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of 27 studies exploring the
relationship between income inequality and the incidence of mental
health problems. Of these articles, 9 found a positive association, 10
found mixed results, and 8 found no association. The meta-analysis
included both qualitative evaluation and pooled empirical analysis of
select study results. The authors concluded, “Income inequality
negatively affects mental health but the effect sizes are small and
there is marked heterogeneity among studies.” Second, Tibber et
al. (2022) systematically reviewed 42 subnational studies (i.e., within
countries rather than across countries) and determined whether they
supported the Income Inequality Hypothesis or the Mixed Neighbourhood
Hypothesis. A plurality of these studies focused on US populations.
After controlling for absolute deprivation, approximately 55 percent of
the studies supported the IIH, 12 percent supported the MNH, and the
remaining studies (roughly 1/3) did not establish a conclusive
association. The results were robust to mental health conditions,
geographical unit size, and across countries with different incomes.</p>
<p>Considering these systematic reviews, as well as one-off studies,
pursuing additional research on the relationship between income
inequality and mental health is warranted. Given the heterogeneity in
effects among countries and geographies, focusing on how the
relationship between income inequality and mental health differs across
regions of the US would be valuable. In addition, are there differences
in the association between rural and urban areas (e.g., predominantly
rural vs urban counties)?</p>
<p>In terms of measures, focusing on the prevalence of mental health
problems would be a good place to start (i.e., the frequency of mental
health issues within a population). Depending on the answer to that
question, does the extent or severity of mental health problems matter
too?</p>
<p>Lastly, distinguishing between subjective and objective measures
seems critical, as they could produce different results. We should be
careful to understand how our variables were measured and their
potential limitations.</p>

<li><p>Abstract: “The causal association between absolute income and
health is well-established; however, the relationship between income
inequality and health is not. The conclusions from the received studies
vary across the region or country studied and/or the methodology
employed. Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia
panel survey, this paper investigates the relationship between mental
health and inequality in Australia. A variety of income inequality
indices are calculated to test both the income inequality and relative
deprivation hypotheses. We find that mental health is only adversely
affected by the presence of relative deprivation to a very small degree.
In addition, we do not find support for the income inequality
hypothesis. Importantly, our results are robust to a number of
sensitivity analyses.”</p></li>

<li>“An important distinction is made between two hypotheses within the

association for some individuals within a group; and the income
inequality hypothesis (IIH), which is a stronger association, suggesting
that the whole reference group is adversely affected by the inequality
within the group.”<br />
</li>
<li>“The problem of endogeneity between mental health and individual
income arises given that having a mental-health shock may reduce wages,
just as having an income shock may reduce mental health. Using household
income helps to reduce the potential for bias as other individuals
within the household can still earn money, but this is not fully
satisfactory.”<br />

<li>Psychological well-being as an alternative outcome; no significant

<li>“As far as we can tell from these European data, our analysis
finding lack of effects of inequality on subjective well-being in
advanced nations are likely to reflect a much broader pattern, extending
to subjective health, mental well-being, quality of government services,
and even to income itself.”</li>
<li>“Our findings suggest that research on inequality and well-being
needs to distinguish systematically between developing and advanced
societies: Inequality works differently in each type of society. And GDP
per capita needs to be explicitly controlled throughout since it is
correlated with inequality and stands as a good proxy for other
important aspects of socioeconomic development (wealth, corruption,
democracy, the rule of law, regulation of business).”</li>

<li><p>Abstract: “The ‘income inequality hypothesis’ holds that beyond a
certain level of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the
association between absolute income, health and mortality weakens, and
the distribution of income across a society becomes more important as a
determinant of a range of outcomes including average mental and physical
health. Recent reviews suggest that the empirical reality of the income
inequality hypothesis is now established but fierce debate remains about
what explains the association. In this article we describe three
hypotheses that have emerged in the literature to explain the
association—the social capital, the status anxiety and the
neo-materialist hypotheses before operationalizing each, and testing
their ability to explain the relationship between income inequality
measured using the GINI coefficient and mental well-being measured using
the WHO5 scale. We use multi-level models and data from the European
Quality of Life Survey which contains information from 30 countries and
over 35,000 individuals. Results give most support to the status anxiety
and social capital hypotheses and almost no support to the
neo-materialist hypothesis. Measures representing the social capital
hypothesis reduce the coefficient measuring income inequality by 55% in
high GDP countries and render it insignificant as well as providing the
best fitting model as measured by AIC and BIC value. However, variables
representing the status anxiety hypothesis reduce the income inequality
coefficient by more in lower GDP countries.”</p></li>
<li><p>Notes:</p>

<li>income inequality hypothesis implies that a society’s distribution
of income is a determinant of mental and physical health outcomes</li>
<li>income inequality measured using GINI coefficient</li>
<li>mental health measured using WHO5 scale</li>
<li>the article suggests there’s some empirical consensus on the
existence of this effect but differing views on the explanation and

<li>this paper focuses on Europe, so our question related to US persons
is still relevant; also this appears to be country-level rather than

<li><p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Income inequality relates to higher rates of obesity, heavy

<li>It links to less exercise, physical/mental issues, heart

</ul></li>
<li><p>Abstract: “A growing body of research suggests a relationship
between health and income inequality. This study specifically analyzes
the correlation between income inequality, measured by state-level Gini
coefficients from the American Community Survey (ACS), and individual
behavioral, physical, and mental health outcomes from the Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for 2006 through 2014. After
controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health
insurance status, year trends, and state fixed effects, income
inequality was found to have significant relationships with behavioral,
physical, and mental health outcomes, including heavy drinking, obesity,
exercise, diabetes, heart attack, heart disease, physical and mental
health problems, and depression, and often the impact on low-income
individuals is slightly smaller than on the high-income group. The
research suggests that economic policies to address the rising income
inequality in the United States might serve to also address some of our
nation’s most troubling health statistics.”</p></li>
<li><p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This study incorporates many other health variables and could be
useful for different SMART questions too</li>
<li>state-level Gini coefficient data across the USA</li>
<li>“Health outcome measures and demographic information were obtained
as cross-sectional data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s (CDC) annual Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS)”
<ul>
<li>our data also draws from this original data source</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“Finally, to measure mental health, variables concerning depression
and anxiety diagnoses, as well as whether or not the individual
experienced poor mental health in the past month were studied.”</li>
<li>found a significant negative association between mental health and
inequality
<ul>
<li>“Among the mental health variables, depressive disorder and having
mental health problems in the past month proved to have a significant
relationship with the Gini coefficient. However, the association was
found to be negative, suggesting that an increase in income inequality
would actually result in a 7.7 and 1.7-percentage-point reduction in the
likelihoods of depression and mental health problems in an individual,
respectively, with slightly larger reductions for the lowest income
group (Table 2). This negative association is particularly surprising
given the literature indicating a positive relationship, but may be
explained by the limitations of the BRFSS dataset, an important
consideration in understanding the data from the entire study.”</li>

inequality and health: A causal review</a>. Social Science &amp;
Medicine, Volume 128, March 2015, Pages 316-326.</p></li>
<li><p>Abstract: “There is a very large literature examining income
inequality in relation to health. Early reviews came to different
interpretations of the evidence, though a large majority of studies
reported that health tended to be worse in more unequal societies. More
recent studies, not included in those reviews, provide substantial new
evidence. Our purpose in this paper is to assess whether or not wider
income differences play a causal role leading to worse health. We
conducted a literature review within an epidemiological causal framework
and inferred the likelihood of a causal relationship between income
inequality and health (including violence) by considering the evidence
as a whole. The body of evidence strongly suggests that income
inequality affects population health and wellbeing. The major causal
criteria of temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack
of alternative explanations are well supported. Of the small minority of
studies which find no association, most can be explained by income
inequality being measured at an inappropriate scale, the inclusion of
mediating variables as controls, the use of subjective rather than
objective measures of health, or follow up periods which are too short.
The evidence that large income differences have damaging health and
social consequences is strong and in most countries inequality is
increasing. Narrowing the gap will improve the health and wellbeing of
populations.”</p></li>
<li><p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the article opens by establishing there is a strong causal link
between income inequality and population health; however, the evidence
on whether it also applies to “mental health, and public health issues
such as violence, teenage births, child wellbeing, obesity, and more” is
less clear</li>
<li>Fig 1 “shows a cross sectional association between income inequality
in developed countries and an index which combines data on: life
expectancy, mental illness, obesity, infant mortality, teenage births,
homicides, imprisonment, educational attainment, distrust and social
mobility.”
<ul>
<li>“Income inequality is measured by the ratio of incomes among the
richest compared with the poorest 20% in each country.” (same as one of
the measures we plan on using)</li>
<li>index combines several outcomes; we want to disentangle these
relationships</li>
<li>USA definitely seems to have worse outcomes and greater inequality
compared to other developed countries; not clear what the sub-national
relationship is though</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“There are now perhaps as many as 300 peer-reviewed studies of the
relation between income inequality and measures of health or
homicide.”</li>
<li>geographic scale for income inequality measures is important – less
support for the relationship as it becomes more granular</li>
<li>conclusions: “The body of evidence on income inequality and health
points strongly to a causal connection. The major criteria of
temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack of
alternative explanations are well supported. Of the small minority of
studies which find no association, most can be explained by income
inequality being measured at an inappropriate scale, the inclusion of
mediating variables as controls, the use of subjective rather than
objective measures of health, or follow up periods which are too
short.”</li>

inequality.”</li>
<li>existing literature is limited
<ul>
<li>“Despite growing interest, there has been less research into the
association between inequality and mental health than there has into the
association with physical health [49]. Nonetheless, several systematic
reviews of relevance have been undertaken. Burns and colleagues [50]
undertook a systematic review of schizophrenia, and found that across
data from 26 countries, there was a higher incidence rate of the
condition in higher income countries (β = 1.02; Z = 2.28; p = 0.02; 95%
CI = 1.00, 1.03). In a systematic review and meta-analysis of depression
[51], from 26 papers (of which 12 were included in the meta-analysis),
the authors reported a greater risk of depression in populations with
higher inequality (RR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.07–1.31).”</li>
<li>“Only one review paper to date [52], however, has attempted to
synthesise the literature on the association between inequality and
mental health across different presentations. In their paper, the
authors undertook a systematic review of 27 papers and a meta-analysis
of nine studies, and concluded that there was a weak association between
higher income inequality and any mental health difficulty (pooled
Cohen’s d = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.01–0.11). However, in defining their search
terms they included only broad definitions of mental health problems
rather than specific diagnostic categories. Consequently, a number of
studies of relevance may have been missed, and biases may have been
introduced with respect to study selection. In addition, they did not
assess the impact on their findings of including only studies that had
controlled for absolute deprivation. However, without controlling for
absolute deprivation, any reported effects of inequality may be driven
by this factor rather than inequality per se [53, 54].”</li>

<li>systematic review found the most support for income inequality
hypothesis, but a large proportion of studies reported no significant
association or mixed associations

<li>“Based on a systematic review of the literature we consistently
found greater support for the IIH over the MNH … However, a high
proportion of studies supported neither hypothesis, reporting no
significant association between inequality and mental health, or else
mixed patterns of associations.”</li>

<li>main outcome measures were mostly self-reported and/or
subjective</li>
<li>“The effect of income inequality on health may work through the
influence of invidious social comparisons (particularly among white
subjects) and (among black subjects and Latinos) through a reduction in
social capital. Researchers may find it fruitful to recognise the
cultural specificity of any such effects.”</li>
